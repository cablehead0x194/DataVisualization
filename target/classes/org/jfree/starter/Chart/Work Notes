To do List:

-Clean up
    ->Delegate methods in main to classes for conciseness.
    -> Modify case 3 menu.
    ->Allow modifiable data inputs for X and Y, float, date, etc
    ->Might need to add a skip line on myReader in the dataIO class under the filereader for uploading data set.
    ->Reading file IO needs to be updated to be able to identify type of information being loaded (int, double, float, etc) to properly upload data.
    ->Graphing methods are not able to load information

-Create exceptions with try/call statements to keep program from crashing with incomaptible inputs.
