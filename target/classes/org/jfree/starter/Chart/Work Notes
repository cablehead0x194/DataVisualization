To do List:

-Clean up
    ->Continue to delegate methods in main to classes for conciseness.
    ->Might need to add a skip line on myReader in the dataIO class under the filereader for uploading data set.
    ->Reading file IO needs to be updated to be able to identify type of information being loaded (int, double, float, etc) to properly upload data.
    ->Graphing methods are not able to load information due to above issue.

-Create exceptions with try/call statements to keep program from crashing with incomaptible inputs.
